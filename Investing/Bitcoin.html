<h2 id="1-bitcoin-s-risk-characteristics">1. Bitcoin&#39;s Risk Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: Bitcoin exhibits high volatility and lower liquidity compared to traditional asset classes, which adds to its unique risk profile in institutional portfolios. However, its risk can be quantified and managed using standard risk modeling approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Bitcoin’s weekly return distribution shows a positive mean of 2.5%, but with a large standard deviation of 13.2%, indicating significant price swings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-low-correlation-with-traditional-asset-classes">2. Low Correlation with Traditional Asset Classes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: Bitcoin has historically shown low correlation with traditional asset classes like equities, fixed income, and commodities, which makes it a valuable diversification tool in a portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: The rolling 120-day correlation between Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 index remains close to zero, meaning that Bitcoin behaves independently of major stock market movements, especially over the long term.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-volatility-is-not-synonymous-with-risk">3. Volatility is Not Synonymous with Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: While Bitcoin is volatile, volatility does not necessarily imply high risk in an institutional portfolio. Its volatility is manageable if allocated in small proportions, and Bitcoin’s long-term growth prospects justify its inclusion.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: During the COVID-19 market crash in early 2020, Bitcoin showed short-term high correlation with equities, but over the long term, its price movements were uncorrelated with traditional markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-bitcoin-as-a-portfolio-diversifier">4. Bitcoin as a Portfolio Diversifier</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: Due to its low correlation with other asset classes, adding Bitcoin to a portfolio can improve diversification and reduce overall portfolio risk, despite Bitcoin’s high individual volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: In a portfolio with 5% Bitcoin allocation, Bitcoin contributed 16% of the overall portfolio risk, but the overall concentration in equities decreased from 80% to 69%, improving portfolio diversification.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-performance-during-stress-events">5. Performance during Stress Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: During periods of market stress, Bitcoin can behave similarly to equities, but its long-term risk-return profile still makes it an attractive asset. Its high volatility needs to be counterbalanced by lower weighting in a diversified portfolio.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: During the market turmoil of March 2020, Bitcoin and equity markets saw their correlation spike, but in the long term, Bitcoin reverted to its lower correlation pattern with traditional assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-bitcoin-s-positive-return-skew">6. Bitcoin’s Positive Return Skew</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lesson</strong>: Bitcoin exhibits a return distribution with positive skew, meaning it has a tendency to produce extreme positive returns. This asymmetry provides an opportunity for outsized gains in a portfolio with controlled downside risk.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: Even in years when Bitcoin underperformed, such as 2014 and 2018, portfolios with 5% Bitcoin allocation only underperformed by around 3%, while the potential for upside gains remained substantial.</li>
</ul>
