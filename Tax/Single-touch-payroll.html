<h2 id="key-concepts-of-single-touch-payroll-stp-">Key Concepts of Single Touch Payroll (STP)</h2>
<h3 id="1-stp-overview">1. STP Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>A government initiative that requires businesses to digitally report employees&#39; payroll and superannuation data directly to the ATO (Australian Taxation Office) every pay day.</li>
<li>STP Phase 1 was introduced for businesses with 20 or more employees in 2018 and expanded to smaller businesses in 2019.</li>
<li>Employees can access their payment summaries (now called &quot;Income Statements&quot;) via their myGov account.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-stp-phase-2">2. STP Phase 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expansion to include additional data such as income types, reasons for employee terminations, and country codes for employees working overseas.</li>
<li>Removal of the need for businesses to issue certain tax file number declarations and employment separation certificates, as this data is now incorporated into STP reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-stp-reporting">3. STP Reporting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employers must submit payroll reports, including employee wages, PAYG withholding, and superannuation contributions, with every pay run.</li>
<li>At the end of the financial year, employers make a finalisation declaration to confirm the accuracy of reported data. Employees&#39; income statements are then marked &quot;Tax Ready&quot; in their myGov accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-year-end-payroll-reconciliation">4. Year-End Payroll Reconciliation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employers must reconcile their payroll records with their ATO submissions before finalising STP reports.</li>
<li>Key steps include verifying employee details, reconciling superannuation payments, and ensuring correct categorisation of payroll items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-employee-and-contractor-payments">5. Employee and Contractor Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Employer must report salary, wages, and superannuation information for employees and certain payments for contractors if they fall under a voluntary agreement.</li>
<li>Contractor payments not managed via payroll solutions (e.g., through accounts payable) are generally not subject to STP reporting.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-amendments-and-corrections">6. Amendments and Corrections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corrections to STP data can be made through an &quot;update event&quot; or during the next pay run.</li>
<li>If an overpayment or misclassification is detected, employers are required to amend the employee&#39;s records and submit updated information to the ATO within 14 days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-key-stp-definitions">7. Key STP Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pay Event</strong>: A report submitted each pay day that includes gross salary, PAYG withholding, and superannuation details.</li>
<li><strong>Update Event</strong>: A correction submitted outside of a regular pay event to rectify errors in previously reported data.</li>
<li><strong>Finalisation Declaration</strong>: A confirmation made at the end of the financial year that all payroll information is correct.</li>
</ul>
