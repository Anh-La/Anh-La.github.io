<h1 id="partnerships-2024">Partnerships</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A partnership is defined under tax law as &quot;an association of persons carrying on a business as partners or in receipt of ordinary income or statutory income jointly, but does not include a company.&quot; For tax purposes, the existence of a partnership is determined based on the facts relevant to each case. A formal partnership agreement is not required for tax purposes.</p>
<h2 id="creation-of-partnership">Creation of Partnership</h2>
<p>Evidence of a partnership may include joint ownership of business assets, joint bank accounts, shared profits/losses, and public recognition of the business as a partnership. Partnerships can be used for income splitting, reducing the overall tax liability of family members.</p>
<h2 id="taxation-of-a-partnershipa">Taxation of a Partnershipa</h2>
<p>A partnership does not pay income tax itself but must lodge a Partnership tax return (Form P). If partners only derive rent, interest, or dividends jointly, a partnership return is not necessary. Each partner is individually taxed on their share of partnership net income (PNI), and losses are deducted in the partner&#39;s personal income tax return.</p>
<h2 id="partnership-net-income-pni-">Partnership Net Income (PNI)</h2>
<p>PNI is defined by s.90 ITAA36 as the balance after deducting allowable deductions and losses from assessable income. PNI is divided according to the partnersâ€™ profit/loss sharing ratio. Payments such as salaries or interest to partners are not deductions for the partnership, while interest from loans by partners to the partnership are.</p>
<h2 id="dividend-imputation">Dividend Imputation</h2>
<p>If a partnership receives franked dividends, the income is &quot;grossed up&quot; to include the franking credit, and the franking credit is apportioned between the partners.</p>
<h2 id="partnership-losses">Partnership Losses</h2>
<p>A partnership cannot carry forward losses. Losses are distributed to the partners in the year incurred.</p>
<h2 id="partnership-capital-gains-losses">Partnership Capital Gains/Losses</h2>
<p>Capital gains and losses are not included in PNI; individual partners are assessed on their share of any gains or losses.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-matters">Miscellaneous Matters</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Deduction Allowed</strong>: Superannuation contributions and life insurance premiums for partners are not deductible by the partnership but are instead deductions for the individual partners.</li>
<li><strong>Payments to Relatives and Associated Persons</strong>: The ATO has discretion to allow only reasonable deductions for payments made to relatives, associated persons, or related entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uncontrolled-partnership-income-upi-">Uncontrolled Partnership Income (UPI)</h2>
<p>UPI provisions (s.94 ITAA36) are designed to prevent tax avoidance. UPI applies when a partner does not have real and effective control over their share of PNI. Partners who are minors are exempt from UPI.</p>
<h2 id="structural-changes-to-partnerships">Structural Changes to Partnerships</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trading Stock</strong>: A change in partnership ownership is treated as a notional disposal of stock, and any profit or loss is assessable to the old owners unless an election is made to use the stock value without disposal.</li>
<li><strong>Depreciable Assets</strong>: When there is a change in ownership, adjustments may be required under balancing adjustment rules if at least one partner has an interest before and after the change.</li>
</ul>
