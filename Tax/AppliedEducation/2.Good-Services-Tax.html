<h1 id="gst-bas-summary">GST &amp; BAS Summary</h1>
<h2 id="gst-basics">GST Basics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>GST (Goods and Services Tax)</strong>: A broad-based tax of 10% on most goods and services sold or consumed in Australia.</li>
<li><strong>Businesses Required to Register</strong>:<ul>
<li>Annual turnover of $75,000 or more (for non-profits: $150,000 or more).</li>
<li>Taxi or ride-sourcing services, regardless of turnover.</li>
<li>Businesses claiming fuel tax credits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-gst-works">How GST Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Businesses charge GST on sales and claim GST credits for the GST paid on their business purchases.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: A timber merchant sells to a furniture maker, who sells to a retailer, and ultimately the consumer bears the GST cost, with each party in the chain remitting the GST on sales to the ATO.
a<h2 id="claiming-gst-credits">Claiming GST Credits</h2>
</li>
<li>Businesses can claim GST credits for purchases used in their taxable sales.</li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If you sell printing services and your expenses include GST, you can offset the GST paid on purchases from the GST collected on sales.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="registration-for-gst">Registration for GST</h2>
