<h1 id="trusts">Trusts</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A trust is established when there is a separation of legal ownership from the beneficial ownership of an asset. Trusts are created for various purposes, such as holding investment assets, providing superannuation benefits, or ensuring the deceased&#39;s family members are provided for. Trusts are governed by state law and are not defined in the ITAA.</p>
<h2 id="trust-terminology">Trust Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Settlor</strong>: The person who creates the trust and transfers property to the trustee.</li>
<li><strong>Trust Deed</strong>: A document outlining the terms of the trust, including the powers of the trustee and the beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Trust Property (Corpus)</strong>: The property held under trust, such as money, real estate, or shares.</li>
<li><strong>Trustee</strong>: The person or entity with legal title to the trust property but no benefit from it. The trustee owes a duty of care to the beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Beneficiaries</strong>: The individuals or entities who benefit from the trust. Beneficiaries can be people or objects (e.g., a trust for a charitable purpose).</li>
<li><strong>Legal Disability</strong>: Conditions that prevent a beneficiary from claiming their share, such as being a minor or having a mental incapacity.</li>
<li><strong>Present Entitlement</strong>: A beneficiaryâ€™s right to receive trust income that is legally available and has an absolute interest.</li>
<li><strong>Inter-Vivos Trust</strong>: A trust created during the life of the settlor.</li>
<li><strong>Will Trusts</strong>: Trusts that arise upon the death of the settlor and are managed according to the terms of the will.</li>
<li><strong>Vesting Day</strong>: The day the trust terminates, and the beneficiaries are entitled to the trust property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="liability-of-the-trustee">Liability of the Trustee</h2>
<p>A trustee is answerable as the taxpayer for income derived by the trust but is not personally liable for the taxes unless they fail to retain sufficient funds to pay them.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-trusts">Types of Trusts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discretionary Trusts</strong>: The trustee has discretion over how much income to distribute to beneficiaries.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Trusts</strong>: Beneficiaries receive predetermined shares of the trust estate.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Trusts</strong>: A variation of fixed trusts where ownership is divided into fixed units.</li>
<li><strong>Deceased Estate Trusts</strong>: Trusts created from the assets of a deceased individual.</li>
<li><strong>Family Trusts</strong>: Trusts that distribute income to family members.</li>
<li><strong>Testamentary Trusts</strong>: Trusts established by a will to manage the deceased estate property.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="net-trust-income-nti-">Net Trust Income (NTI)</h2>
<p>NTI is the trust&#39;s assessable income for the year minus allowable deductions. Trust deductions do not include personal expenses paid on behalf of beneficiaries.</p>
<h2 id="taxation-of-trusts">Taxation of Trusts</h2>
<p>A trust is not a separate taxable entity, but it must file a tax return. Trust income is taxed based on whether the beneficiary is presently entitled and whether they are under a legal disability. If no beneficiary is entitled, the trustee is taxed at the highest marginal rate.</p>
<h2 id="trust-losses">Trust Losses</h2>
<p>Trust losses are retained and carried forward to offset against future trust income. Special trust loss tests apply to discretionary and fixed trusts.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Franking Credits</strong>: Beneficiaries entitled to franked dividend income from a trust can claim a franking tax offset.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Gains</strong>: Trusts can apply the 50% CGT discount and small business CGT concessions where applicable.</li>
</ul>
