<h2 id="background-facts-and-assumptions">Background Facts and Assumptions</h2>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this report is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To outline the high-level Australian tax implications of the proposed structure for the acquisition of the Property.</li>
<li>To provide, where relevant, recommendations on tax risk mitigation strategies.</li>
<li>This report considers Australian tax implications only and does not consider tax implications associated with other jurisdictions such as Jersey and Saudi Arabia.</li>
</ul>
<p>The in-bound investment structure in this report is based on your email dated 16 February 2018, and that structure and associated steps are reproduced on page 6.</p>
<h3 id="background-facts-and-assumptions">Background Facts and Assumptions</h3>
<p>We understand the background facts and relevant assumptions, to the extent that they relate to Australian income tax, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XYZ</strong> is an independent investment advisory firm with offices in London (head office), Chicago, Kuala Lumpur, and Sydney, specializing in advising Middle East and Malaysian investors on their international real estate investments. XYZ is the investment manager.</li>
<li><strong>Capital Co</strong> is an authorized investment firm licensed by the Saudi Capital Market Authority and domiciled in Saudi Arabia. Capital Co is ultimately owned by four individuals from the Rich family.</li>
<li>The principal investors would be a few high net worth individual (HNWI) Saudi nationals who invest through Capital Co’s Discretionary Portfolio Management arrangement (DPM).</li>
<li>XYZ has identified a commercial property, the Hotel and Childcare Centre, located in Brisbane, Aus, that it has decided is a suitable investment opportunity for Capital Co (the Property). The acquisition will be in freehold and the Property will comprise the following:<ul>
<li>An 82-key Apartment Hotel operated by Brisbane Tenancy Ltd on a 15-year lease.</li>
<li>A ground floor childcare centre with car parks to be operated by Petit Early Learning Pty Ltd on a 15-year lease.</li>
<li>Three vacant ground floor units with a development authority for retail, professional, or commercial lease, which may not be fully let at completion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Property is partly finished with some construction left, and practical completion and delivery of the finished Property by the contractor, Keane Construction, is scheduled for March 2018.</li>
<li>The Property will be acquired as a standing investment, pre-let to two tenants, both with brand new 15-year leases from practical completion in April 2018. The anticipated hold period is five years from completion in April 2018. The core strategy is to provide the investor with a highly attractive secured income return, in a rapidly growing strategic location backed by strong, diversified tenants on long leases.</li>
<li>The Purchaser will exchange contracts with the Vendor on or about 19 March 2018, and a condition of the sale contract is that settlement will only occur on practical completion of the Property, meaning that the Property should be sold as a GST-free going concern with leases in place at the time of sale (except the ground floors).</li>
<li>The purchase price of the Property is A$27,140,000, and the Purchaser will fund the acquisition through a mixture of investor equity and third-party debt.</li>
<li>The proposed transaction is required to adhere to Islamic financing principles.</li>
<li>Senior debt in the form of conventional non-Shariah compliant debt from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at 60% LVR will be used to fund the acquisition of the Property.</li>
<li>As a result, the Shariah board requires there to be no equity/controlling interest by Capital Co in the ABC, and any funds advanced will be through Shariah compliant debt instruments, which in this case will be Commodity Murabaha.</li>
<li>To achieve Shariah compliance and use conventional bank debt, the ultimate owners of the Australian Unit Trust must be independently owned from the Capital Co Group. To achieve this, a Jersey Trust will be set up known as a Purpose Trust.</li>
<li>The level of gearing in respect of Australian debt (being bank debt from the Commonwealth Bank provided at the ABC level) is likely to be approximately 60% of the purchase price of the Property, leaving an equity requirement of approximately A$12.54 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please advise us if our understanding of the background facts or assumptions is incomplete or inaccurate, as this may impact our analysis and conclusions regarding the structure of the proposed transaction and the likely tax implications thereof.</p>

<h3 id="structure-steps">Structure Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Establishment of Purpose Trust 1</strong>: </p>

<hr>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>
<h4 id="acquisition-of-property">Acquisition of Property</h4>
<p><strong>Tax Issues and Comments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Purchase Price and Incidental Costs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purchase price paid by ABC for the Brisbane Property, along with incidental costs such as stamp duty and professional advisor fees, should be included in the cost base of the Property for Australian Capital Gains Tax (CGT) purposes and/or allocated to the cost of depreciable plant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GST Treatment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acquisition of the Brisbane Property should not be subject to GST as the transaction is considered a GST-free supply of a going concern.</li>
<li>For the ground floor units that are vacant at settlement, a 10% GST will apply. However, full input tax credits should be available for this GST on the assumption that these areas will be leased post-settlement, although this will increase the stamp duty cost.</li>
<li>It is crucial that ABC is registered for GST before settlement to ensure the GST-free going concern treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deductibility of Construction Costs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The construction cost of the building should be deductible as part of capital works deductions, typically at a rate of 2.5%. Further analysis may justify a higher rate of 4%, particularly if it can be demonstrated that the property use qualifies as a “hotel”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stamp Duty Considerations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC will be required to pay stamp duty on the acquisition at a rate of 5.75%. Further analysis is necessary to determine whether the additional foreign acquirer duty surcharge will apply. The GST-free treatment should effectively reduce ABC&#39;s stamp duty liability on purchase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="ongoing-taxation-of-abc">Ongoing Taxation of ABC</h4>
<p><strong>Tax Issues and Comments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Flow-Through Entity Treatment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC should be treated as a ‘flow-through’ entity for Australian income tax purposes. The trustee of ABC will be liable for tax on behalf of the non-resident beneficiary, with the applicable rates currently at 30% for non-resident corporate beneficiaries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>MIT Status and Withholding Tax</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the HNWI and DPM investors are a small number of individuals, ABC will not qualify as a Managed Investment Trust (MIT) and therefore will not be eligible for the reduced rate of 15% withholding tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>GST Input Tax Credits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC should be able to claim full input tax credits for GST included in its incurred costs, as these costs relate to taxable supplies from leasing hotel and commercial premises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="calculation-of-taxable-income-of-abc">Calculation of Taxable Income of ABC</h4>
<p><strong>Tax Issues and Comments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Rental Income and Deductions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental income derived by ABC should be included in its assessable income for the relevant income year.</li>
<li>ABC should be entitled to deductions for expenses such as depreciation (including building allowance), interest, establishment costs, land tax, investment manager costs, trust running costs, and other costs incurred in generating assessable income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interest Withholding Tax</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest payments made by ABC for the unit holder loan will be subject to a final withholding tax of 10%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Treatment of Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributions of income exceeding taxable income (due to depreciation) will not be assessable and instead will require a reduction in the cost base of Hold Co’s units in ABC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Interest Deductibility and Thin Capitalisation Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interest incurred by ABC (from both CBA loan and unitholder loan) should be deductible, subject to thin capitalisation and arm’s length rules.</li>
<li>The thin capitalisation rules are unlikely to limit interest deductibility for ABC as its total debt deductions, including associate entities, are projected to be less than $2 million. This threshold should be monitored closely.</li>
<li>A Reasonably Arguable Position Paper will be required to support the associate entities of ABC, including Fin Co, Capital Co entities, HNWI, and DPM investors and their associates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Carrying Forward Tax Losses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ABC incurs a tax loss in a particular year, it should be able to carry forward and utilize the loss, subject to the trust loss recoupment rules (e.g., the 50% stake test or the income injection test).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Borrowing Costs Deductibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming ABC satisfies the thin capitalisation rules, its borrowing costs are likely to be deductible on a compounding accruals basis over the loan&#39;s life (assuming ABC elects into TOFA).</li>
<li>Robust transfer pricing support will be necessary to validate the interest rate and deduction amounts for the unitholder loan to avoid potential re-characterisation by the Commissioner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sale-agreement-considerations">Sale Agreement Considerations</h4>
<p><strong>Tax Issues and Comments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sale Agreement Review</strong>:<ul>
<li>The sale agreements have not been reviewed; however, comments on critical matters that should be addressed in the sale agreement or during the sales process include:<ul>
<li>Application of the GST going concern provisions.</li>
<li>Treatment of non-resident vendors, including confirming residency status and securing appropriate warranties/indemnities.</li>
<li>Allocation of purchase price and its impact on capital allowance deductions.</li>
<li>Confirmation that the transaction does not require FIRB notification based on legal advice received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="disposal-of-property-or-units-in-abc">Disposal of Property or Units in ABC</h4>
<p><strong>Tax Issues and Comments</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on Disposal</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any gain from the sale of property or units in ABC (or interests in upstream entities) may be taxable under Australian CGT provisions at a rate of 30% if these interests are deemed ‘land rich’ for CGT purposes.</li>
<li>The cost base of the building and depreciable plant will be based on their tax carrying value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Foreign Residents Capital Gain Withholding (FRCGW)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>As Hold Co is a non-resident, any future sale of the property may be subject to FRCGW, requiring purchasers to withhold 12.5% of the gross purchase price. This tax collection mechanism needs to be managed appropriately at the relevant time and is not an additional tax.</li>
<li>Further advice will be required based on the specific facts, circumstances, and prevailing legislation at the time.</li>

<h4 id="ongoing-monitoring-of-debt-deduction">Ongoing Monitoring of Debt Deduction</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reasonably Arguable Position Paper</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepare a paper to support the position that the de minimis exemption applies, ensuring that interest deductions are not denied.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Debt Deduction Monitoring</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuously monitor and review total debt deductions (including interest, line fees, reset fees for CBA debt, unitholder loan, and Commodity Murabaha) to ensure they remain within the de minimis threshold of A$2 million on a year-by-year basis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Commodity Murabaha Tax Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a tax analysis of the Commodity Murabaha transaction to ensure the deductibility for Hold Co and protect against future capital gains on exit or other taxable distributions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="review-of-financial-model">Review of Financial Model</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Assumption Revisions</strong>:<ul>
<li>Review the financial model in light of the changed assumptions outlined in this report, particularly focusing on:<ul>
<li>The impact of the percentage of the unitholder loan compared to unit equity.</li>
<li>Arms-length considerations.</li>
<li>Distribution to Hold Co (post-interest deductions) taxed at 30%, if applicable.</li>
<li>Application of the 4% capital allowance deduction or lower rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="transfer-pricing-analysis-and-support">Transfer Pricing Analysis and Support</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arms-Length Analysis and Documentation</strong>:<ul>
<li>Conduct an arms-length analysis and prepare documentation to support the quantum and rate of interest deductions for the unitholder loan, especially in relation to the gearing level in the ABC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="plant-property-and-equipment">Plant, Property, and Equipment</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Tax Depreciation and Deductions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirm tax depreciation, capital allowance, and capital works deductions to be provided by the vendor or a Quantity Surveyor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Higher Rate for Hotel Capital Allowances</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undertake further analysis and prepare support to adopt the higher 4% rate for hotel capital allowances, distinguishing the specifics of this transaction from the general Australian Taxation Office (ATO) position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="stamp-duty">Stamp Duty</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foreign Resident Surcharge Duty Analysis</strong>:<ul>
<li>Conduct further analysis on the application of the foreign resident surcharge duty and either apply for a ruling or prepare supporting analysis to confirm the position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="acquisition-of-brisbane-property-tax-consequences">Acquisition of Brisbane Property – Tax Consequences</h3>
<h4 id="cgt-cost-base">CGT Cost Base</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Purchase Price and Incidental Costs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purchase price paid by ABC for the Brisbane Property, including incidental acquisition costs such as stamp duty and professional advisor fees, should form part of the cost base of the Property for Australian Capital Gains Tax (CGT) purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unit Holder Contributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contributions made by Hold Co to ABC, along with any relevant incidental costs, should form part of the cost base of the units in ABC for CGT purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Adjustment for Tax-Deferred Distributions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost base of units in ABC (held by Hold Co) will need to be adjusted for ‘tax deferred’ trust distributions. This adjustment occurs when income exceeds taxable income, such as when deductions for depreciation are claimed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="capital-allowance-deductions-division-40-deductions-">Capital Allowance Deductions (Division 40 Deductions)</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Allocation of Purchase Price</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sale Agreement for the Property does not specify the allocation of the purchase price to Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&amp;E). This allocation will be confirmed at closing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Determination of Allocation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the absence of a specific allocation in the Sale Agreement, the purchaser is typically required to determine the allocation of the purchase price to PP&amp;E. This is generally done by a Quantity Surveyor on a reasonable basis and is used as the basis for claiming depreciation deductions by ABC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Choice of Depreciation Method</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC has the choice of rate and method for calculating the decline in value of depreciating assets. This includes self-assessing the effective life and choosing between the diminishing value method or the prime cost method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="capital-works-deductions-division-43-deductions-">Capital Works Deductions (Division 43 Deductions)</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Basis for Deductions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital works deductions are based on the original cost of the building and the extent of Division 43 deductions already claimed, regardless of the allocation of the purchase price in the Sale Agreement or the market value at the time of acquisition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deduction Rates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Division 43 amounts are generally deductible at a rate of 2.5%, or in some circumstances, a higher rate of 4% may apply, depending on when the Property was constructed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vendor’s Provision of Information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is generally expected that the vendor will provide ABC with a detailed summary of the Division 43 deductions available for future claims, particularly for newly constructed buildings. It is recommended that ABC formally requests this information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="4-vs-2-5-for-capital-works-deductions">4% vs. 2.5% for Capital Works Deductions</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Standard and Higher Rates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard rate for Division 43 deductions is 2.5%. A higher rate of 4% may apply if the Property is used as a hotel, motel, or guest house. However, if the Property is used as an apartment, the 4% rate does not apply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Determining Property Use</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The classification of the Property as either an apartment or a hotel is based on factual circumstances. A hotel is characterized by sole occupancy rooms where the primary offering is the accommodation area itself (bedroom). In contrast, an apartment typically features multiple facilities and services within the accommodation area, such as a kitchen, laundry, dining, and living areas, in addition to the bedroom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Hotel Operation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To determine the applicable rate for capital works deductions, it is necessary to understand how the Hotel is being operated at the Property. Further consideration and analysis are required to confirm the use of the 4% rate.</li>

<li><p><strong>GST-Free Acquisition</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The acquisition of the Brisbane Property should not be subject to GST because the transaction should be considered a GST-free supply of a going concern. This is based on the following criteria:<ul>
<li>Settlement will occur only after the practical completion of the Property with leases (or agreements for leases) in place at the time of sale.</li>
<li>ABC will be registered for GST at the time of settlement.</li>
<li>Both ABC and the vendor have agreed in writing to the application of the going concern treatment to the transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Vacant Ground Floor Units</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the ground floor units are vacant at settlement, the acquisition of these parts of the property will be subject to a 10% GST. However, ABC should be entitled to claim full input tax credits for this GST, assuming that these areas will be leased following settlement. This will result in an increased stamp duty cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Review of Sale Contract</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sale contract should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that it includes appropriate clauses related to the GST-free going concern treatment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="stamp-duty">Stamp Duty</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Stamp Duty Payable</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stamp duty will be payable by ABC on the acquisition of the Brisbane Property at the applicable Queensland stamp duty rates. The maximum rate is generally 5.75% of the purchase price for commercial property, including hotels, motels, and similar assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Application for Ruling</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application for a ruling may be necessary for the Commissioner to confirm that the property will be treated as commercial residential premises, thereby exempting it from the additional foreign acquirer duty surcharge of 3%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Impact of GST-Free Treatment on Stamp Duty</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If GST-free treatment is applied to the acquisition, it should lead to a reduction in ABC&#39;s stamp duty liability. Stamp duty is typically calculated based on the GST-inclusive purchase price, so if the transaction is GST-free, the stamp duty base is reduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Stamp Duty Allocation for CGT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stamp duty costs should be included in ABC&#39;s cost base of the Brisbane Property for CGT purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Queensland Foreign Residential Surcharge Rate</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Queensland government has announced an increase in the foreign residential surcharge rate from 3% to 7%, making the top rate of duty 12.75%. The legislation for this increase is expected to be introduced into Parliament soon.</li>
<li>Given the recent introduction of this legislation in October 2016, there is limited precedent regarding serviced apartments. Other states have different rules that provide more certainty.</li>
<li>It is unclear if there will be other changes to the operation of the provisions, but it is possible that some definitions may be clarified, or it may simply be a rate increase.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Applicability of Surcharge</strong>: <ul>
<li>The surcharge applies to land used solely or predominantly for residential purposes. It is clear that hotels and motels are excluded from this definition.</li>
<li>The treatment of residential properties, such as serviced apartments, is unclear. If the serviced apartments are standalone accommodations suitable for long-term stays (several months) and usable by family units, the surcharge may apply to the purchase of the land.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="current-revenue-office-ruling">Current Revenue Office Ruling</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Examples of Land Subject to AFAD Residential Land Surcharge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Established homes and apartments, including self-contained studio apartments.</li>
<li>Vacant land intended for the construction of homes or apartments.</li>
<li>Land designated for residential development, such as small unit block developments, housing subdivisions, and major developments with a residential component.</li>
<li>Land with buildings intended to be refurbished, renovated, or extended for residential use, such as converting a disused warehouse into residential apartments or demolishing a commercial block for residential development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Examples of Land Not Subject to AFAD Residential Land Surcharge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Land used for short-term accommodation, such as hotels or motels.</li>
<li>Dormitory-style student accommodation.</li>
<li>Other types of residential properties, such as retirement villages, manufactured home parks, and student accommodation (other than dormitory-style), may qualify as AFAD residential land if the use meets the residential test. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis, based on the facts of the matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ruling Request</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the ambiguity in the legislation and limited precedence in Queensland since its introduction in 2016, it is recommended to seek a ruling from the Queensland Office of State Revenue to confirm the stamp duty position on the acquisition of the land.</li>
<li>Preparation for the ruling is currently underway, and an information request will be sent shortly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Approach</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An alternative to obtaining a ruling is to submit the transaction for stamping on the basis of exemption and wait to see if the revenue office investigates the position.</li>
<li>If this approach is pursued, it is recommended to document the position at the time of the transaction, particularly the expected use of the land by site area and the nature of the expected stays in the serviced apartments.</li>

<h3 id="foreign-resident-capital-gains-withholding-frcw-">Foreign Resident Capital Gains Withholding (FRCW)</h3>
<h4 id="overview-and-obligation">Overview and Obligation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose and Requirement</strong>: <ul>
<li>The FRCW imposes an obligation on purchasers to withhold <strong>12.5%</strong> of the purchase price and remit it to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) when a vendor sells certain asset types, such as the property in question.</li>
<li>This withholding is not an additional tax but a mechanism to ensure tax collection from vendors, particularly those who are foreign residents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conditions-and-compliance">Conditions and Compliance</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Australian Resident Vendor</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>If the vendor is an Australian resident, they can avoid the withholding requirement by providing the purchaser with a <strong>clearance certificate</strong> from the ATO before settlement.</li>
<li>The clearance certificate confirms that the vendor is an Australian resident, thereby exempting the transaction from the FRCW withholding requirement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Obligations of Purchasers</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasers, regardless of their residency status (Australian resident or foreign resident), are required to withhold the specified amount and pay it to the Commissioner of Taxation at settlement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recommendations-and-precautions">Recommendations and Precautions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Sale Agreement and Documentation</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Given the nature of the vendor group involved in the transaction, it is crucial to address the FRCW requirements in the Sale Agreement.</li>
<li>It is prudent to ensure that the Sale Agreement explicitly outlines the obligations regarding FRCW, and that appropriate measures are taken to comply with these obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Residency Certificate</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to obtain a residency certificate to confirm the vendor&#39;s status and to ensure that the purchaser’s obligations under the FRCW are met.</li>

<h4 id="classification-and-structure">Classification and Structure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flow-Through Treatment</strong>: <ul>
<li><strong>ABC</strong> should be treated as a ‘flow-through’ entity for Australian income tax purposes.</li>
<li>Certain rules in the Australian tax legislation classify some widely held trusts that carry on trading activities as deemed corporate taxpayers. However, these rules are not expected to apply to ABC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="public-trading-trust-ptt-consideration">Public Trading Trust (PTT) Consideration</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Division 6C of the ITAA 1936</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under Division 6C, a trust may be taxed as a company if classified as a <strong>Public Trading Trust (PTT)</strong>.</li>
<li>A trust is considered a PTT if it is a <strong>Public Unit Trust (PUT)</strong> and a trading trust that is either resident in the income year concerned or was a PTT in a previous income year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Public Unit Trust (PUT) Criteria</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trust is a PUT if its units are offered to the public or held by 50 or more persons.</li>
<li>Units are considered offered to the public if an offer or invitation is made to the public to subscribe or purchase units.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Concentration Test</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unit trust is not a PUT if, at any time during the year, 20 or fewer persons hold 75% or more of the beneficial interests in the income and property of the trust.</li>
<li>Interposed trusts are generally required to be traced through when applying the concentration test.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment of ABC</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the proposed structure and background facts, <strong>ABC</strong> is not likely to satisfy the conditions to be considered a PUT and therefore, should not be classified as a PTT.</li>
<li>The analysis of whether ABC is a trading trust has not been considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="investment-and-distribution-considerations">Investment and Distribution Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Investment Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The investment is tightly held by High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI) and DPM.</li>
<li>The Commodity Murabaha is not a qualifying membership interest, indicating that ABC is unlikely to satisfy Managed Investment Trust (MIT) requirements and will not be eligible for the lower rate of 15%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tax Rate on Distributions to Hold Co</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Co, as a beneficiary, should have a present entitlement to the distributable income of ABC each income year.</li>
<li>The trustee of ABC is liable to pay tax on behalf of the non-resident beneficiary (Hold Co) based on the rates for non-resident corporate beneficiaries (currently <strong>30%</strong>). This tax is creditable to Hold Co in determining its Australian taxable income.</li>
<li>It is not projected for there to be taxable distributions of this type during the period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Expectations for Excess Losses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) generally expects a reasonable expectation of net taxable income being generated over time for excess losses to continue being deductible.</li>
<li>This expectation may need to be addressed in supporting the applicable interest rate (see unitholder loan discussion below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="distribution-policy">Distribution Policy</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Present Entitlement and Tax Liability</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where a beneficiary is presently entitled to a share of trust income and is a non-resident at the end of the income year, the trustee is primarily liable to pay tax on that share.</li>
<li>The Trustee for ABC must ensure that all relevant income for an income year is distributed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Tax Deferred Amounts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distributions of income exceeding taxable income (known as the tax deferred amount) should not be assessable or subject to withholding tax.</li>
<li>Instead, the cost base of units in ABC (held by Hold Co) will need to be adjusted for ‘tax deferred’ trust distributions.</li>

</ul>
<h4 id="deductions">Deductions</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Eligible Deductions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC is entitled to claim deductions for various expenses or outgoings incurred in generating assessable income. These may include:<ul>
<li><strong>Depreciation</strong> (including building allowance).</li>
<li><strong>Interest expenses</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Establishment costs</strong> (certain types).</li>
<li><strong>Land tax</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Investment manager costs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Trust running costs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Other relevant costs</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Borrowing Costs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrowing costs (excluding interest) are generally deductible over a period of 5 years or the term of the loan, whichever is shorter.</li>
<li>Certain establishment costs may also be deductible over a 5-year period.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tax-losses">Tax Losses</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Carrying Forward Tax Losses</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ABC incurs a tax loss in a particular year, it can carry forward and utilize the tax loss in future years, subject to satisfying the trust loss recoupment rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trust Loss Recoupment Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>These rules are complex in Australia. Generally, if ABC is classified as a ‘fixed trust’, it is easier to satisfy the carry forward tax loss rules compared to a ‘non-fixed trust’.</li>
<li>A trust is considered a fixed trust if persons have fixed entitlements to all of the income and capital of the trust.</li>

<h4 id="interest-and-borrowing-costs">Interest and Borrowing Costs</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deductibility Under Thin Capitalisation Provisions</strong>:<ul>

<li>These provisions deny deductions for losses or outgoings relating to the portion of the taxpayer’s total debt that exceeds a ‘maximum allowable debt amount’, unless the de minimis exemption applies (discussed in detail later).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="management-of-losses">Management of Losses</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Qualification as a Fixed Trust</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If ABC qualifies as a fixed trust under the trust deed, losses should be able to be carried forward, provided the 50% stake test is satisfied.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the income injection test can be satisfied.</li>
<li>This needs to be managed and supported appropriately to utilize the losses from year to year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Trust Deed Review</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructions were given to lawyers to draft the trust deed as a fixed trust.</li>
<li>A review of the draft unit trust deed (as per the email dated 7 March 2018) confirms it is consistent with a typical fixed trust.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Entitlement to Claim Input Tax Credits</strong>:<ul>
<li>ABC is entitled to claim full input tax credits for the GST included in the costs it incurs. This is based on the premise that these costs are related to taxable supplies, specifically the leasing of a hotel and commercial premises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="taxation-of-financial-arrangement-tofa-regime">Taxation of Financial Arrangement (TOFA) Regime</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overview of TOFA Provisions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TOFA provisions determine the amount and timing of the taxation of gains and losses for financial arrangements. This does not include financial arrangements that are specifically excluded by the TOFA rules or those that do not exceed 12 months in term.</li>
<li>Under the TOFA rules, gains are assessable, and losses are deductible on a revenue account to the extent they are incurred in generating assessable income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Precedence of TOFA Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>TOFA rules in Division 230 take precedence over other provisions in the income tax legislation and apply to the financial arrangements of an entity that exceeds specific economic thresholds outlined in section 230-5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Economic Thresholds for TOFA Application</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entities are excluded from the TOFA regime if they have:<ul>
<li>Aggregate turnover of less than $100 million.</li>
<li>Financial assets of less than $100 million.</li>
<li>Total assets of less than $300 million.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>TOFA Status for New Entities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For newly created entities like ABC, the TOFA status for the first year of income is determined by applying the economic threshold at the end of the first year the entity comes into existence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Election into the TOFA Regime</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entities not mandatorily subject to the TOFA regime can elect to have the TOFA rules apply to them. This election is made in the first income tax return of ABC and is irrevocable.</li>
<li>Once subject to Division 230, all financial arrangements entered into by the entity from the relevant income year onwards will be governed by the TOFA rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ABC’s Position on TOFA</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When considered in isolation, ABC does not meet the thresholds for the mandatory application of the TOFA regime. However, potential associate rules may apply.</li>
<li>To provide certainty and more accurately reflect the underlying economic substance of financing arrangements, it is recommended that an election be made into the regime.</li>

<h4 id="compliance-and-tax-rate">Compliance and Tax Rate</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Australian Tax Return Obligations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Co is required to prepare and lodge an annual Australian tax return.</li>
<li>Hold Co&#39;s assessable income should include taxable income derived from its unit holding in ABC, related to income to which ABC is entitled and which is withheld at 30%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deductibility of Interest Payments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC will be primarily debt-funded by way of a unitholder loan with interest payments withheld at a rate of 10%.</li>
<li>Any deductions that Hold Co would be entitled to under the Commodity Murabaha will be limited to the portion of the funding that is referable to the equity units Hold Co has in ABC.</li>
<li>Hold Co is not entitled to deduct borrowing costs referable to amounts that have already been subject to interest withholding tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Uncertainty on Deductibility of Commodity Murabaha Payments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is uncertainty about whether payments under the Commodity Murabaha are deductible in the same manner as interest on a loan.</li>
<li>Finance costs (such as interest) associated with Hold Co&#39;s debt that is used to fund its equity in ABC are ordinarily deductible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Deductibility of Payments Under Commodity Murabaha</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If payments under the Commodity Murabaha are assumed to be deductible as interest, financing expenses paid under the Commodity Murabaha should (prima facie) be deductible to Hold Co when calculating its Australian sourced taxable income.</li>
<li>This assumes that the Commodity Murabaha is considered a &#39;debt interest&#39; for Australian income tax purposes, subject to thin capitalisation and transfer pricing rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Connected Entity Rule</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be an argument that the Commodity Murabaha from Hold Co to Fin Co is part of a scheme designed so that the return (by way of interest) is to be used to fund a return (by way of dividend payment).</li>
<li>This could result in the disallowance of the interest deduction, referred to as the &#39;connected entity rule&#39;, which is discussed further in the context of the unitholder loan.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="deductibility-of-commodity-murabaha">Deductibility of Commodity Murabaha</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Uncertainty in Tax Treatment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is significant uncertainty surrounding the tax treatment of Commodity Murabaha.</li>
<li>The report does not provide a definitive opinion on the income tax issues associated with the Commodity Murabaha as nothing turns on its Australian tax treatment in this paper, except for its relevance to the de minimis thin capitalisation calculation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Issues Noted in Board of Taxation’s Discussion Paper</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Board of Taxation&#39;s discussion paper issued in October 2010 noted some issues related to the income tax treatment of Commodity Murabaha, particularly around the deductibility of those payments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Recommendation for Further Analysis</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended to conduct further analysis on the deductibility of Commodity Murabaha payments.</li>
<li>If a reasonably arguable position can be substantiated based on the terms of the Commodity Murabaha, it may be prudent to prepare and lodge tax returns for Hold Co, claiming the deductions.</li>
<li>This should be done subject to staying below the thin capitalisation de minimis thresholds before the due date for the lodgment of any tax returns.</li>

<h3 id="australian-thin-capitalisation-regime">Australian Thin Capitalisation Regime</h3>
<h4 id="tax-issue-and-comments-on-the-australian-thin-capitalisation-regime">Tax Issue and Comments on the Australian Thin Capitalisation Regime</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Debt Structure and Deductibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC’s purchase of the Brisbane Property is likely to be 60% debt-financed through a conventional non-Shariah compliant debt structure from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA).</li>
<li>The Commonwealth Bank senior debt is considered a relevant debt interest under Australia&#39;s income tax laws.</li>
<li>Financing costs paid by ABC under the senior debt are deductible for tax purposes, subject to Australia’s thin capitalisation rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Thin Capitalisation Provisions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all Australian entities are subject to thin capitalisation provisions; the de minimis test applies if total debt deductions are A$2 million or less.</li>
<li>Australian entities are subject to thin capitalisation provisions if ‘controlled’ by a foreign entity.</li>
<li>ABC, owned and controlled by the non-resident entity Hold Co, is treated as foreign-controlled and is subject to thin capitalisation provisions.</li>
<li>The thin capitalisation rules limit the Australian debt deductions for foreign-controlled Australian entities (like ABC) when debt funding exceeds the entity’s maximum allowable debt level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Maximum Allowable Debt Levels</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum allowable debt for trusts with foreign unit holders is the greater of:<ul>
<li>The Safe Harbour Debt Amount</li>
<li>The Arm’s Length Debt Amount</li>
<li>The Worldwide Gearing Debt Amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Safe Harbour Debt Amount</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broadly, the current safe harbour debt amount is equal to 60% of an Australian entity’s average adjusted assets less non-debt liabilities, translating to a 1.5:1 debt-to-equity ratio.</li>
<li>ABC’s safe harbour debt amount is calculated based on its total funding and senior debt from CBA.</li>
<li>ABC is likely to be geared beyond the safe harbour limit at inception, with a total funding of $27.14M and senior debt of $14.595M.</li>
<li>Without the de minimis exemption or the arm’s length debt test, ABC is likely to have no excess debt capacity at the acquisition of the Brisbane Property.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="de-minimis-exemption-and-associate-entities">De Minimis Exemption and Associate Entities</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>A$2 Million Threshold – De Minimis Exemption</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The thin capitalisation regime does not apply if the total debt deductions of an entity and its associates for an income year are A$2 million or less.</li>
<li>ABC’s total debt deductions, including interest on the CBA loan, interest on the unit holders&#39; loan, and payments under the Commodity Murabaha, are expected to be less than A$2 million annually.</li>
<li>The de minimis exemption may apply; however, the total debt deductions for all of ABC’s associate entities for the income year must be included.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Assessment of Associate Entities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between Hold Co and Fin Co is crucial. If Fin Co is an associate entity of ABC, all debt deductions from Fin Co, Capital Co entities, and Hold Co must be included in ABC’s total debt deductions.</li>
<li>Fin Co is considered an associate of ABC if it has a “majority voting interest” or “sufficient influence” over Hold Co.</li>
<li>Hold Co will be sufficiently influenced by Fin Co or other entities if its directors are expected to act according to the directions, instructions, or wishes of Fin Co.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Application of Associate Entity Rules</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Co, as a 100% owner of equity units in ABC, is an associate of ABC.</li>
<li>The assessment of sufficient influence involves reviewing all relevant documents, including the WAAD and advisory agreements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Support for the De Minimis Position</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure Fin Co and Hold Co are not regarded as associate entities, the Commodity Murabaha must operate as an arm’s-length financing arrangement.</li>
<li>Capital Co, through Fin Co, must maintain an arm’s-length borrower/lender relationship with Hold Co, as Shariah compliance prohibits involvement in conventional debt transactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reasonably Arguable Position Paper (RAPP)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation of a RAPP is advised to support the de minimis position and mitigate penalties if challenged by the Commissioner.</li>
<li>A reasonably arguable position can protect against penalties if the taxpayer took ‘reasonable care’ in complying with tax law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="impact-of-movements-on-de-minimis">Impact of Movements on De Minimis</h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Factors Affecting De Minimis Exemption</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The A$2 million debt deduction threshold may be affected by:<ul>
<li>Movement in interest rates, given the CBA facility’s floating rate</li>
<li>Reset events under the CBA facility</li>
<li>Unitholder loan ratio</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Arm’s Length Debt Test – Application to ABC</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the de minimis exemption does not apply, the alternative would be to satisfy the arm’s length debt test.</li>
<li>The arm’s length debt test often provides a higher debt amount than the safe harbour debt amount and involves a transfer pricing exercise focusing on the entity’s Australian income-producing activities.</li>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Criteria for Debt Interest Classification</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The financing arrangement must create an effectively non-contingent obligation for the issuer (ABC) to make payments that equal or exceed the amount received.</li>
<li>For loans with a term of 10 years or less, no discounting of returns is necessary to establish the loan as a debt interest, allowing it to be classified as such under the rules.</li>

<ul>
<li>A provision within the Australian debt/equity rules (section 974-80 of the ITAA 1997) stipulates that a loan, which would typically be treated as a debt interest, is classified as an equity interest if the scheme is designed so that the return is used to fund a return to another entity and that return is equity-like.</li>
<li>A ‘connected entity’ is either an associate of the entity or a member of the same wholly-owned group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Potential Arguments and Concerns</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be an argument that the unitholder loan is structured so that interest payments fund a return to Fin Co, and subsequently to HNWI and DPM investors. However, it is arguable that the scheme should not be treated this way since the interest payments are only one part of Hold Co&#39;s total income.</li>
<li>According to the Commissioner’s guidelines (TD 2015/2), the entirety of the funding arrangement and income sources need to be considered to apply the connected entity rule.</li>
<li>It is unlikely, based on current tax rulings, that the Commissioner would apply section 974-80 to deny interest deductions on the unitholder loan to Hold Co.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Uncertainty and Proposed Changes</strong>: The application of the connected entity rule is uncertain, and legislative changes might occur following the Board of Taxation’s review of the debt/equity provisions. Monitoring the progress of these amendments is crucial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interest Payments – Withholding Tax</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Withholding Tax Rate</strong>: A 10% withholding tax applies to interest payments made by ABC under the unitholder loan.</li>
<li><strong>Timing of Withholding</strong>: Withholding is required on interest paid or payable, including interest reinvested or otherwise dealt with on behalf of the non-resident.</li>
<li><strong>Reporting and Payment Processes</strong>: ABC must have processes in place to manage the timing of reporting and remittance of withholding tax on interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transfer Pricing Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Australian Transfer Pricing Regime</strong>: The regime requires robust documentation to ensure that the interest rate and the amount of deductions for the unitholder loan are justified.</li>
<li><strong>Arm&#39;s Length Principle</strong>: The interest rate should reflect what would be expected between independent parties under similar conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Circumstances</strong>: The transfer pricing analysis should consider the economic circumstances of the loan, including the accumulation of losses, to avoid potential re-characterization of the loan as equity.</li>
<li><strong>Prudent Interest Rate</strong>: It may be advisable to adopt an interest rate that demonstrates the potential for net taxable income over the life of the project.</li>

<h3 id="investment-structure-overview">Investment Structure Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Background and Purpose</strong>:
The proposed investment structure involves HNWI (High-Net-Worth Individual) investors and DPM (Discretionary Portfolio Management) investors. The structure is designed to raise approximately AUD 85 million to finance the acquisition of an Australian office property, referred to as the &quot;Target Property.&quot; This will be done through a unit trust structure with a combination of equity and loan financing.</p>
<p><strong>Key Parties Involved</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fin Co</strong>: A Cayman Islands-incorporated entity.</li>
<li><strong>Hold Co</strong>: A Singapore-incorporated entity that will hold the shares of ABC.</li>
<li><strong>ABC</strong>: The Australian unit trust that will own the Target Property.</li>
<li><strong>HNWI and DPM Investors</strong>: These investors will provide funding to Fin Co.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Structure</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Investors contribute capital to Fin Co, receiving equity in exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Fin Co lends AUD 85 million to Hold Co.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Hold Co on-lends the funds to ABC as a unitholder loan.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: ABC uses the funds to acquire the Target Property and issues equity to Hold Co, which is then held by Fin Co.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="calculation-of-taxable-income-abc">Calculation of Taxable Income – ABC</h3>
<p><strong>Tax Issue:</strong><br>ABC will be required to prepare and lodge an annual income tax return and adhere to other Australian tax compliance obligations. This includes lodging Business Activity Statements to report GST payments and credits.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong><br>ABC must comply with Australian tax regulations, including registration for a Tax File Number (TFN), an Australian Business Number (ABN), and GST reporting. Additionally, distribution statements must be issued to Hold Co, summarizing taxable and non-taxable components of distributions.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance Requirements / Administrative Issues:</strong>  </p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare and lodge annual income tax return.</li>
<li>Register for TFN, ABN, and GST reporting.</li>
<li>Issue distribution statements to Hold Co.</li>
<li>Make resolutions regarding Hold Co’s entitlement to trust income by 30 June.</li>
<li>Pay tax on ABC’s taxable income.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tax Issue:</strong><br>There are potential permanent establishment (PE) risks associated with the structuring fees and management fees invoiced by XYZ entities and the offshore investment manager.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Structuring and management fees from XYZ entities may not necessarily create a PE risk, but a thorough review of documentation is needed to finalize this view.</li>
<li>Internal arrangements indicating that the XYZ Australian entities are directed by offshore entities could influence the assessment of PE risk.</li>
<li>Engagement of an offshore related party as the investment manager requires ensuring that their activities in Australia do not create a PE. Investment manager fees should reflect arm’s length rates, and any recharge of costs should be carefully monitored for transfer pricing risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compliance Requirements / Administrative Issues:</strong>  </p>
<ol>
<li>Review documentation for PE risk related to structuring and management fees.</li>
<li>Ensure offshore investment manager fees are at arm’s length.</li>
<li>Monitor activities of offshore related parties to avoid creating a PE in Australia.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="disposal-of-units-or-property-interests">Disposal of Units or Property Interests</h3>
<p><strong>Tax Issue:</strong><br>Gains from the sale of units in ABC or interests in upstream entities may be subject to Australian Capital Gains Tax (CGT) at a rate of 30% if the entity is deemed &#39;land rich.&#39; For CGT purposes, an entity is &#39;land rich&#39; if more than 50% of its assets&#39; market value comprises Australian real property or leases of Australian real property. The capital gain is calculated as the excess of capital proceeds over the CGT cost base of the equity interests. The CGT cost base should be adjusted for any tax-deferred distributions made by ABC to Hold Co.</p>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>The 50% CGT discount available to the Trust does not apply to distributions to non-residents.</li>
<li>The capital gain from the sale of Brisbane Property by ABC is also subject to Australian CGT at a rate of 30%, with the gain calculated as the excess of capital proceeds over the CGT cost base of the Property, adjusted for any depreciation and capital allowances claimed. This gain may be offset by revenue and capital losses at the time of disposal.</li>
<li>Capital losses on the sale of units or Property are determined by the excess of the reduced cost base over capital proceeds. Unlike revenue losses, capital losses can only offset current or future capital gains.</li>
<li>Excess deductions or tax losses in Hold Co can reduce the taxable capital gain on exit, potentially resulting in a partial refund.</li>
<li>Non-resident withholding tax (NRWCT) may apply to any subsequent sale, and withholding obligations need to be managed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Compliance Requirements / Administrative Issues:</strong>  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>CGT Provisions:</strong> Ensure compliance with CGT provisions for the sale of units and Brisbane Property, including adjustments to the CGT cost base.</li>
<li><strong>Discounts and Exemptions:</strong> Be aware that the 50% CGT discount does not apply to non-resident distributions.</li>
<li><strong>GST Treatment:</strong> The sale of units is input taxed if the purchaser is based in Australia, which may restrict input tax credits. If the purchaser is international, it may be GST-free.</li>
<li><strong>Property Sale GST:</strong> The Brisbane Property sale may qualify as a GST-free going concern if fully leased at the time of sale. If not, GST will apply, but input tax credits should be claimable for related costs.</li>
</ol>
